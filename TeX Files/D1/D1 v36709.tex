\begin{enumerate}
    \item Consider the number $9,912,800.8491$. Identify and name each of the place values used in this number. Write these names using both a numerical label (e.g.\ ``10s'') and an English-word label (e.g.\ ``tens'').

    \begin{ansenv}
        9 is in the millions (1,000,000) place.
9 is in the hundred-thousands (100,000) place.
1 is in the ten-thousands (10,000) place.
2 is in the thousands (1,000) place.
8 is in the hundreds (100) place.
0 is in the tens (10) place.
0 is in the units (1) place.
8 is in the tenths (1/10) place.
4 is in the hundredths (1/100) place.
9 is in the thousandths (1/1000) place.
1 is in the ten-thousandths (1/10,000) place.

    \item Using flats to represent the units, draw a base-ten block representation of the number 5.44.

    \vfill
    \begin{ansenv}
        0 large cubes, 5 flats, 4 longs, and 4 small cubes

Look at the blocks you chose to represent $5.44$. Why did you choose each type of block in that particular order? What is the relationship between each of the place values in $5.44$, and how do the base-ten blocks help to demonstrate that relationship? Fully explain all parts of your answer.
